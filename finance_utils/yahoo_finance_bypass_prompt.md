# Yahoo Finance Rate Limiting Bypass - Comprehensive Prompt

## Context
I'm experiencing persistent Yahoo Finance API rate limiting (HTTP 429) on my IP address `88.209.93.31` while trying to fetch stock data using Python's `yfinance` library. The rate limiting has persisted for over 24 hours despite minimal API usage.

## Current Situation
- **Platform**: macOS (latest version)
- **IP Address**: 88.209.93.31 (appears to be rate-limited)
- **Error**: HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" on all Yahoo Finance endpoints
- **Duration**: 24+ hours of persistent blocking
- **Python Library**: yfinance
- **Use Case**: Stock data analysis for personal project

## What I've Already Tried
1. **Basic Network Resets**: 
   - DNS cache flush (`sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`)
   - DHCP lease renewal (`sudo ipconfig set en0 DHCP`)
   - Wi-Fi interface restart (`networksetup -setairportpower en0 off/on`)

2. **Request Configuration**:
   - Different User-Agent headers
   - Request delays and retry strategies
   - Alternative Yahoo Finance endpoints (query1, query2)

3. **Network Analysis**:
   - Confirmed all Yahoo Finance endpoints return 429
   - No "Retry-After" header provided
   - Multiple IP checking services confirm same public IP

## What I Need Help With

### Primary Goal
Bypass Yahoo Finance rate limiting to resume stock data collection for my personal analysis dashboard.

### Specific Questions
1. **IP Address Change Methods**:
   - Most effective ways to change public IP on macOS without VPN
   - Router/modem reset procedures for ISP IP rotation
   - Mobile hotspot setup and data usage considerations

2. **VPN Solutions**:
   - Best free VPN services for macOS (Proton VPN, Windscribe, etc.)
   - VPN configuration for Python requests
   - Proxy integration with requests library

3. **Technical Workarounds**:
   - Alternative Yahoo Finance endpoints or mirrors
   - Request header manipulation techniques
   - Session management and cookie handling

4. **Alternative Data Sources**:
   - Free APIs comparable to Yahoo Finance (Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud)
   - Migration strategies from yfinance to alternative sources
   - Rate limiting best practices for new APIs

5. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Tor browser integration for Python requests
   - Proxy rotation strategies
   - Request distribution across multiple IPs

### Code Context
```python
import yfinance as yf
import requests

# Current failing code
ticker = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
data = ticker.history(period="1y")  # Returns 429 error

# Direct request also fails
response = requests.get('https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/AAPL')
# Status: 429
```

### Environment Details
- **OS**: macOS (latest)
- **Python**: 3.13
- **Network**: Home Wi-Fi (likely dynamic IP from ISP)
- **ISP**: [Your ISP if known]
- **Use Case**: Personal stock analysis dashboard

## Desired Outcome
1. **Immediate**: Restore Yahoo Finance API access
2. **Short-term**: Implement robust rate limiting handling
3. **Long-term**: Diversify data sources for reliability

## Constraints
- Prefer free solutions initially
- Must work with existing Python codebase
- Minimal disruption to current workflow
- macOS-compatible solutions only

## Success Metrics
- Ability to fetch stock data for symbols: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA
- Historical data access (1 year period)
- Sustainable solution for ongoing use
- Integration with existing Flask dashboard

Please provide:
1. **Step-by-step solutions** with exact commands/code
2. **Multiple approaches** ranked by effectiveness
3. **Risk assessment** for each method
4. **Long-term sustainability** considerations
5. **Backup plans** if primary solution fails

## Additional Context
This is for a personal learning project involving stock market analysis and visualization. The goal is educational, not commercial. I'm looking for legitimate ways to access public financial data while respecting rate limits and terms of service.
